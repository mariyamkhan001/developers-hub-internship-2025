# 📦 Part 2 – Advanced Data Science Projects

This folder contains the second batch of internship projects from the Developers Hub Data Science Internship (June 2025). These projects focus on solving real-world problems in HR, text summarization, healthcare, and finance using machine learning and deep learning.

## ✅ Tasks Included:

### 1. 🧑‍💼 Employee Attrition Prediction  
- **Dataset:** IBM HR Analytics Dataset  
- Built a classification model to predict whether an employee will leave the company  
- Used SHAP for explainability and derived actionable HR strategies  

### 2. 📝 Text Summarization  
- **Dataset:** CNN/DailyMail Dataset  
- Applied extractive and abstractive summarization  
- Used spaCy and HuggingFace Transformers (BERT or GPT models)  
- Fine-tuned the model and evaluated summaries  

### 3. 🩺 Disease Diagnosis Prediction  
- **Dataset:** PIMA Diabetes Dataset or Heart Disease Dataset  
- Built medical diagnostic models using SVM and Gradient Boosting  
- Focused on early disease detection and interpretability  

### 4. 💳 Loan Default Prediction  
- **Dataset:** Lending Club Loan Dataset  
- Trained classification models like LightGBM  
- Handled class imbalance with SMOTE  
- Evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1-score  



### 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn, SHAP, Transformers (HuggingFace), XGBoost, LightGBM
